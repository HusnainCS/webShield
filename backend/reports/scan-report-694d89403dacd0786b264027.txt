**SQL INJECTION STATUS:** UNKNOWN
**RISK LEVEL:** UNKNOWN
**DANGER EXPLANATION:** The SQL injection scan could not complete, so we don't know if the website is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. SQL injection is like someone tricking your website into showing database secrets. Imagine a burglar tricking a guard to open the safe. If the website is vulnerable, attackers can steal user data, passwords, and credit cards.

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:** Since the scan failed, we can't take immediate action. However, it's essential to investigate why the scan failed and ensure the website is secure.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. **Run the scan again**: Try running the SQLMap scan again to see if it completes successfully.
2. **Check the website's logs**: Review the website's logs to see if there are any errors or warnings related to the SQL injection scan.
3. **Consult the website's documentation**: Check the website's documentation to see if there are any specific instructions for running SQL injection scans.
4. **Contact the website's administrator**: Reach out to the website's administrator to report the failed scan and ask for their assistance in investigating the issue.
