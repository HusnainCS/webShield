WEB SECURITY SCAN REPORT
=======================

Scan ID     : 694987d5c586a683d2432cb7
Target URL : https://yasirahmed.tech
Scan Type  : nmap
Scan Time  : Mon Dec 22 2025 23:03:01 GMT+0500 (Pakistan Standard Time)

AI EXPLANATION (Simple Language)
----------------------------------------

I've analyzed the scan results for your website https://yasirahmed.tech. Here's a simplified explanation of the findings:

**What these open ports mean:**

- **80/tcp**: This is the default port for HTTP (web) traffic. Your website is accessible through this port, which means visitors can view your website on https://yasirahmed.tech or http://yasirahmed.tech (without SSL).
- **443/tcp**: This is the default port for HTTPS (secure web) traffic. This port uses the SSL/TLS protocol to encrypt data, making it secure for visitors to access sensitive information.

**Which ports are risky:**

None of the found ports are considered high-risk. Both ports 80 and 443 are commonly used and essential for the normal functioning of a website. However, it's always a good idea to have the HTTPS port (443) more secure as much as possible.

**What should be closed:**

None of the ports found should be closed, as they are essential for the normal functioning of your website. Closing either port might cause issues with visitors accessing your website.

**Simple recommendations:**

1. **SSL/TLS configuration**: Ensure your SSL/TLS configuration is up-to-date and secure. This includes having a valid SSL certificate and proper key lengths.
2. **HTTP vs HTTPS**: Consider redirecting all HTTP requests to HTTPS to ensure that sensitive information is always secure.
3. **Regular updates and maintenance**: Regularly update your website's software and plugins to protect against potential security vulnerabilities.
4. **Use a Content Security Policy (CSP)**: A CSP helps protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by specifying which sources of content are allowed to be executed.

Please note that these recommendations are standard best practices and are not based on any specific issues found during the scan.
