**ENCRYPTION STATUS: Needs improvement**
**ISSUES FOUND:**
* SSLv2 enabled: This is an old, weak protocol that can be easily hacked by attackers.
	+ Why it's dangerous: It can be broken by attackers, making your data insecure.
	+ How serious it is: Critical
* SSLv3 enabled: This is another old, weak protocol that can be hacked by attackers.
	+ Why it's dangerous: It can be broken by attackers, making your data insecure.
	+ How serious it is: Critical
* TLSv1.0 enabled: This is an older protocol that can be hacked by attackers.
	+ Why it's dangerous: It can be broken by attackers, making your data insecure.
	+ How serious it is: High
* TLSv1.1 disabled: This is a good thing, as it's an older protocol that's not as secure.
* TLSv1.0 not vulnerable to heartbleed: This is a good thing, as it means the site is not vulnerable to a specific attack.
* Preferred TLSv1.0 256 bits DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA DHE 1024 bits: This is a strong protocol, but it's still TLSv1.0, which is not the strongest.
* Accepted TLSv1.0 128 bits DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA DHE 1024 bits: This is a weak protocol, as it uses 128-bit encryption.
* Accepted TLSv1.0 256 bits AES256-SHA: This is a strong protocol, but it's still TLSv1.0.
* Accepted TLSv1.0 128 bits AES128-SHA: This is a weak protocol, as it uses 128-bit encryption.
* Accepted TLSv1.0 40 bits TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5: This is a very weak protocol, as it uses 40-bit encryption.

**RISK LEVEL: High**
**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. **Update to stronger protocols**: Switch to TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3, which are the strongest and most secure.
2. **Disable weak protocols**: Disable SSLv2, SSLv3, and TLSv1.0 to prevent attackers from exploiting them.
3. **Use strong encryption**: Use 256-bit encryption or stronger to keep your data secure.
