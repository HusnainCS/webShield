**FINDINGS SUMMARY: 8 web server vulnerabilities**
**RISK LEVEL: Medium**
**SAFETY STATUS: Vulnerable**

**Vulnerability 1:**
* **What it is:** Misconfigured server response headers
* **How serious it is:** Medium risk
* **Is it common or rare:** Common
* **Explanation:** The server is sending unnecessary information in its response headers, which can be used by attackers to gather information about the server.

**Vulnerability 2:**
* **What it is:** Outdated server software
* **How serious it is:** Medium risk
* **Is it common or rare:** Common
* **Explanation:** The server is running an outdated version of Apache, which may contain known security vulnerabilities.

**Vulnerability 3:**
* **What it is:** Missing HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header
* **How serious it is:** Medium risk
* **Is it common or rare:** Common
* **Explanation:** The server is not enforcing HTTPS connections, which can make it easier for attackers to intercept sensitive information.

**Vulnerability 4:**
* **What it is:** Missing Content Security Policy (CSP) header
* **How serious it is:** Medium risk
* **Is it common or rare:** Common
* **Explanation:** The server is not specifying which sources of content are allowed, which can make it easier for attackers to inject malicious code.

**Vulnerability 5:**
* **What it is:** Missing X-Frame-Options header
* **How serious it is:** Medium risk
* **Is it common or rare:** Common
* **Explanation:** The server is not preventing attackers from framing the website in an iframe, which can be used to launch phishing attacks.

**Vulnerability 6:**
* **What it is:** Missing X-XSS-Protection header
* **How serious it is:** Medium risk
* **Is it common or rare:** Common
* **Explanation:** The server is not protecting against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which can be used to inject malicious code.

**Vulnerability 7:**
* **What it is:** Missing Server-Timing header
* **How serious it is:** Low risk
* **Is it common or rare:** Common
* **Explanation:** The server is not providing unnecessary information about its performance, which can be used by attackers to gather information about the server.

**Vulnerability 8:**
* **What it is:** Missing Referrer-Policy header
* **How serious it is:** Low risk
* **Is it common or rare:** Common
* **Explanation:** The server is not controlling which referrer information is sent with requests, which can be used by attackers to gather information about the user.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. **Update server software:** Update the server software to the latest version to fix known security vulnerabilities.
2. **Configure server response headers:** Configure the server to send only necessary information in its response headers.
3. **Implement security headers:** Implement security headers such as HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, and X-XSS-Protection to protect against common web attacks.
