**OPEN PORTS:**
- 21/tcp   open     ftp
- 23/tcp   open     telnet
- 80/tcp   open     http
- 443/tcp  open     https

**COMMON PORTS:**
- Port 80 (http) is a common port for web servers. It's normal to see this port open.
- Port 443 (https) is also a common port for secure web servers. It's normal to see this port open.

**RISKY PORTS:**
- Port 21 (ftp) is a risky port. FTP can be used to transfer files, but it's not as secure as other methods. It's not common to see this port open on a modern server.
- Port 23 (telnet) is a risky port. Telnet is an old protocol that's not secure. It's not common to see this port open on a modern server.

**SAFETY STATUS:**
Unsafe ports found

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. **Close unnecessary ports**: If you don't need FTP or Telnet, consider closing these ports to reduce the risk of a security breach.
2. **Use secure alternatives**: Instead of using FTP, consider using SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) or another secure method to transfer files.
3. **Update your server software**: Make sure your server software is up to date, as newer versions often include security patches and improvements.
