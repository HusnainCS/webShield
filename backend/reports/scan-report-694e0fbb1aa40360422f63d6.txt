	+ If it is common or rare: Common

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. **Update Apache to the latest version**: Regularly update your Apache server to the latest version to ensure you have the latest security patches.
2. **Configure HSTS, CSP, and other security headers**: Ensure that your server is configured to use HSTS, CSP, and other security headers to prevent common web attacks.
3. **Regularly review and update your server configuration**: Regularly review and update your server configuration to ensure that it is secure and up-to-date.
